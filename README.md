FlyingFree
Welcome to FlyingFree, a personal project aimed at building and programming a custom drone from scratch. The goal is to explore the intricacies of flying systems and deepen knowledge in the field of aeronautics and autonomous flight.

Project Overview
The FlyingFree project is designed to understand the principles behind drone mechanics, sensors, and control algorithms. It combines hardware and software elements to create a functional and autonomous flying drone. The project will cover:

Drone Design: Building a stable and efficient frame.
Flight Dynamics: Developing algorithms for stability, navigation, and flight optimization.
Sensor Integration: Utilizing IMUs, GPS, and other sensors for precise control.
Programming: Writing software in C++ and Python to handle control systems, telemetry, and communication.
Motivation
This project is part of my exploration into new fields, expanding my experience from automotive and aviation engineering to autonomous flying systems. It challenges me to learn and apply concepts of aerodynamics, flight stability, and advanced programming for embedded systems.

Project Goals
Design and assemble a robust and efficient drone frame.
Develop and implement a stable flight control system.
Integrate sensors for data gathering and precise maneuvering.
Write and optimize code to manage real-time operations.
Test and improve the system based on performance observations and data analysis.
